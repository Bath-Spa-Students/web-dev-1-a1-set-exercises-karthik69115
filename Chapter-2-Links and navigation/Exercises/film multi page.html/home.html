    <p><u>Trivia :-</u>
        It took Ang Lee 3,000 auditions to find the 17-year-old Sharma.
        Ang Lee replaced Tobey Maguire with Rafe Spall in the role of "The Writer" because he thought that Maguire's fame was distracting from the story,
        and he wanted to keep the cast more international.

    <p><u>Release :-</u>
        Life of Pi was released on November 21, 2012. It was originally scheduled to be released on December 14, 2012,
         but when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was announced for the same release date, Life of Pi was postponed a week.</p>
         <p><u>3D Technology :-</u>
            Lee initially struggled with whether or not to employ 3D technology for the film, citing it's cost and a fear of it being gimmicky.
             But he ultimately decided the advanced technology could bring a painterly, poetic quality to the look.
              While directing 17-year-old actor Suraj Sharma, the director believed he was giving appropriate instructions until he watched the footage in 3D.
               "I'd have to go back to him and bring his performance down because it just enhanced it so much more. It's like a new film language,
               " Lee said, describing his learning curve as "humongous." as Cinemacon, before previewing 10 minutes of footage,
                Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman exclaimed that Lee's accomplishment was on par with the technological breakthrough James Cameron's "Titanic."</p>
